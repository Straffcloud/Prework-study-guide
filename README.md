## This Prework-study-guide was created for Bootcamp students to learn, develop and apply their coding skills to test and build this project to showcase their learning path to be a successful Front End Developer.

There are quite a few new concepts in the Pre work its not complicated as there are references provided for further reading helps breakdown the subject matter. This guide illustrates the commands and step by step process how to apply them with screen shots is so handy for a new starter.  Some research outside of the course work is recommended to problem solve issues and enhance learning.
