# Prework-study-guide

## This is my project to showcase my learning path as a Bootcamp student to be a succesful Front End Developer. 
## I was very much interested to build this project as this a small step towards achieving my challenge and prove that I can code.  The new concepts in my Pre work were not complicated for me, it required my determination and develop my knowledge to work out the commands did take a while and there were setbacks, thankfully my research enabled me to understand the issues well and resolve the issues.  To build this project has made me so cool and that I can show off my coding skills ðŸ˜Š.

## This Prework study guide was so good, the roadmap was the very first part which was quite important that I got informed the details of this study and how I can work towards building my skills to become a Front-End Developer.  

### The roadmap had two phases first was Front-End Foundations and second was Front-End Frameworks.  In the study guide I was able to understand the Developer community, concepts like Growth Mindset, Computational thinking and Agile Software Environment which I found so useful to me as entering this new career path. From there on I leaped slowly into basic coding to learn how to use Command Line, setting up with Git and GitHub.  I went on to build Web applications using HTML, CSS and Java Script, which was the foundations to a web page functions.  I learnt how to write HTML codes to create a simple web page, which is the first step and to make the web page look colourful I learnt CSS styling to my web page and then lastly, to give my web page full meaning to make it functional use JavaScript coding, which was not easy for me to get it right and with some research and help, I was able to complete the web page. I was exposed to VS code and Git Bash to run the codes and sync the files to GitHub, which involved processes hard to master then but now it doesnâ€™t seem so hard as with the practice and details in the Prework study guide was so helpful that has enabled me to build this project and explore further learning with helpful guides and web developer sites given within the Prework study guide.
